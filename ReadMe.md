The repository includes 3 different files which however, can all be run idependently. This was mainly because some functions used in our VGG net required an older version of TensorFlow and we used the script with the regularizors to create images of the training- and validation error during training. Ultimately we decided however to not include the graphics for reasons of being parsimonious.

The code found in this repository is heavily based on the following sources. When we base our arguments on any of these sources we sepereately cite them in our report as well.
